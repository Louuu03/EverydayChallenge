# Everyday Little Challenge
## Introduction
This is a daily challenge of mainly animation.

I always found those animation on websites amazing, so I decided to dig into some cool but little ones to practice everyday. I hope my work can help other people learn and understand more about animation and some usage and as well motivate them. 

However, I always have a lot of problems while coding. If anything confuses you and you can't find the answer of it, or you figure out mistakes or have better solution, feel free to reach me out on Tweeter([@Lou_yiw](https://twitter.com/Lou_yiw)).

Here is the website of the challenge:
